                    In Arknights, there are several factions. 
                    Each faction has its own interest and goals. 
                    Factions can be organizations or nations. 
                    One of them is Kjerag.

                        Kjerag is a religious country with a relatively small territory. 
                        Religious center is Karlan holy mountain, 
                        which is also the source of the Karlan Commercial Co. 
                        Because it snows all the year round, 
                        they call the country "Snow Realm"

                        Kjerag or Kiragg is a mountain in Sandnes municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. 
                        The 1,110-metre (3,640 ft) tall mountain sits on the southern shore of Lysefjorden, 
                        just southwest of the village of Lysebotn.

                    <p>
                        Although the name 'Kjerag' was from Norway, its prototype is obviously not Norway. 
                        Most of the territory of Norway has a temperate maritime climate. 
                        The climate is relatively mild and not cold, 
                        it is impossible to have snowfall throughout the year, 
                        so it does not meet the setting of "Snow Realm" in Kjerag.
